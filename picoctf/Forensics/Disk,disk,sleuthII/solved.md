## Solution
In this challenge, we were given a .gz file. I first extracted it using gunzip.
Next, I ran the following command to check the partition layout inside the image:
```
mmls <imagename>
```
From the output, I noted the position of the Linux partition. To view its contents, I used:
```
fls -o 2048 <imagename>
```
In the listing, I found the root directory with inode 18290. To explore it, I ran:

```
fls -o 2048 <imagename> 18290
```
Inside, I discovered the flag file. To read its contents, I used:
```
icat -o 2048 <imagename> 18291
```
This revealed the flag. âœ…
