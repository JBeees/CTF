## Author : Darkraicg492
## Description
Can you find the flag in this disk image?
Download the disk image [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/536/disko-1.dd.gz).
## Hints
- Maybe Strings could help? If only there was a way to do that?
## Solution
In this challenge, I first decompressed the disk image file. Then, I used the strings command on the .dd file and was able to obtain the flag.
