# TITLE : SSTI1
## Author : VENAX
## Description
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!
## Hint
- Server Side Template Injection
## Solution
From the given hint, we know that this website has a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. SSTI is a web vulnerability that occurs when user input is embedded directly into a server-side template, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious code on the server.

There are many types of template engines, but based on my testing, this one is most likely using Jinja2.

To exploit this, I used Burp Suite. I opened Burp Suite and enabled the Intercept feature. When I attempted to send data through the /announce endpoint on the website, I observed that the request stored the input in a parameter called content.

So, I tried injecting an SSTI payload into this content parameter like this:
```
content={{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag').read()}}

```
After sending the request, I successfully received the flag in the response.
