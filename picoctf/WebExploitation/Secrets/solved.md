# TITLE : Secrets
## Author : Geoffrey Njogu
## Description
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?
The website is running here.
## Hint
- folders folders folders
## Solution
From the provided website, I noticed the CSS file was stored in a folder named secret. Navigating to /secret/ worked, so I opened it and saw it referenced /hidden/. Accessing /hidden/ also succeeded, and it in turn pointed to /superhidden/. Finally, when I visited /superhidden/, I found the flag.
