## Author : zaratec/Danny
## Description
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830
## Hints
- What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
## Solution
To solve this problem, we can take a hint from its title: "robots". On the web, the robots.txt file is used to tell web crawlers which parts of a website should or shouldn’t be accessed.

So, try visiting the robots.txt file by going to the root of the website. You’ll find something like this:

<pre lang="markdown"> User-agent: *  
Disallow: /1bb4c.html </pre>
Once you open /1bb4c.html, you’ll find the flag.
