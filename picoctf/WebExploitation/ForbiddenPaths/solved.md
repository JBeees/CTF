# TITLE : Forbidden Paths
## Author : LT 'syreal' Jones
## Description
Can you get the flag?  
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
## Solution
In this challenge, we are given a website that can read a file. There are three .txt files that we can read, and we are allowed to use .. to backtrack directories. We are also told the name of the flag file. I tried to backtrack until I reached the root directory to read the flag file.  
Example payload:
```
../../../flag.txt
```
