# TITLE : head-dump
## Author : Prince Niyonshuti N.
## Description 
Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
The website is running picoCTF News.
## Hints
- Explore backend development with us
- The head was dumped.
## Solution
In this challenge, the hint says: **"Explore backend development with us"**. So, I checked the #APIDocumentation section in the article. In that hashtag, one of the endpoints mentioned is /heapdump. When I visited that endpoint, it triggered a file download — and the flag was hidden inside that file.
