# TITLE : Unminify
## Author : JEFFERY JOHN
## Description 
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
Browse here, and find the flag!
## Hints
- Try `CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U` in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.
- Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
- What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.
## Solution
To find the flag, you only need to inspect the website. This time, the source code has already been minified but that's okay, because the flag is still there.
