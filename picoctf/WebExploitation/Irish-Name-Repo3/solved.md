## Description
There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29132/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:29132. Try to see if you can login as admin!
## Hints
- Seems like the password is encrypted.
## Solution
In this challenge, the login section only has a password field. I opened Burp Suite and, after submitting a password, I noticed a **debug** variable with a value of 0.

I sent the request to the Repeater and changed the value of debug to 1. This revealed the SQL query being executed:
```sql
password: ' BE 1=1 --
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin WHERE password = '' OR 1=1 --'
```
From the hint, I realized the password is being encrypted using the ROT13 method. In ROT13, BE becomes OR.
So, by entering the payload `' BE 1=1 --` it gets converted to `' OR 1=1 --` 
before execution, which bypasses authentication and reveals the password.
