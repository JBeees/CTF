# TITLE : logon
## Author : BOBSON
## Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44573
## Hints
- Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?
## Solution
In this problem, the system doesn't perform checks for every username—except for Joe. This means anyone can log in as long as the username is not Joe. However, even after logging in, the flag is not immediately revealed.

To investigate further, I used the browser’s **Developer Tools**, specifically the Application tab to inspect the Cookies. I noticed a cookie named admin with the value set to **False**. I manually changed its value to **True**.

After refreshing the page, the flag was displayed.
