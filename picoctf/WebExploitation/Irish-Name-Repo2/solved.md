## Description
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/ (link). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:52849
## Hint
- The password is being filtered.
## Solution
In this challenge, unlike the previous one, the login section cannot be bypassed using SQL injection through the password field. If I try to log in with a payload such as `' OR 1=1 --` in the password field, the system detects it as an SQL injection attempt.

Instead, I placed the payload admin' -- in the username field, which allowed me to comment out the password check entirely. By doing this, I was able to log in as the admin and retrieve the flag.
