## Description 
This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:26704
## Hints
You don't need to download a new web browser
## Solution
To solve this challenge, as the hint said, *"You don't need to download a new web browser"*, I opened BurpSuite to inspect the request history. I found the request to the /flag URL and sent it to the Repeater. Then, I edited the `User-Agent` header to `picobrowser` and resent the request. The flag was returned in the response.
