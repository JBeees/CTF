## Hint
- any redirections?
## Solution
In this challenge, we are given access to a website and login credentials. To retrieve the flag, I used Burp Suite to monitor the redirection history during the login process.

I opened the Proxy tab, then navigated to the HTTP History section, which logs all HTTP requests and responses. After clicking the login button on the website, I observed the redirection flow.

The first redirection was to:
```
/next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs
```
Then it redirected again to:
```
/next-page/id=bF90aGVfd2F5XzI1YmJhZTlhfQ==
```
Both values after id= are Base64-encoded. When decoded, they reveal the flag.
