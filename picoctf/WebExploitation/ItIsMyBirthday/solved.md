# TITLE : It is my Birthday
## Author : madStacks
## Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:48746/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:48746/)
## Hints
- Look at the category of this problem.
- How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?
## Solution
In this problem, we are given a website where we can upload two PDF files that have the same MD5 hash (an MD5 collision). This occurs when two different inputs produce the exact same hash output. To solve it, search online for a pair of files that demonstrate an MD5 collision. Download those files, upload them to the site, and you will get the flag.
