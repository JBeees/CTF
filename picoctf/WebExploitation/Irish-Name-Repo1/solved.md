# TITLE : Irish-Name-Repo 1
## Author : Chris Hensler
## Description 
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/33850/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:33850. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Hints
- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
- Try to think about how the website verifies your login.
## Solution
In this problem, to get the flag, we simply need to log in as an admin. I tried an SQL injection on the login form by entering `' OR 1=1 --` in the password field. This bypassed authentication, and I got the flag.
