## Solution
At first, this problem was a bit confusing. However, I got a clue from the title of the challenge. I decided to check the robots.txt file, and there I found some encoded text. I asked ChatGPT to help decode it, and it pointed me to the path /js/myfile.txt. When I opened that path, I found the flag.
