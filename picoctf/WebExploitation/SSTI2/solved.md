## Description
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! I read about input sanitization, so now I remove any kind of characters that could be a problem :)
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!
## Hints
- Server Side Template Injection
- Why is blacklisting characters a bad idea to sanitize input?
## Solution
This problem is similar to the first one ([SSTI1](https://github.com/JBeees/CTF/tree/main/picoctf/WebExploitation/SSTI1)), but it's more challenging because the server sanitizes input â€” specifically blocking the **dot** `.` and **underscore** `_` characters. To solve it, you only need to replace **dot** `.` with **|attr**, and **underscore** `_` with its hexadecimal form `\x5f`. Doing this correctly will allow you to retrieve the flag.
