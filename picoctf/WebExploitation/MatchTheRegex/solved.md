## Description
How about trying to match a regular expression
The website is running here.
## Hint
- Access the webpage and try to match the regular expression associated with the text field.
## Solution
To get the flag in this challenge, I viewed the source code of the page and found the following regular expression: // `^p.....F`. This means it is looking for a word that starts with 'p', ends with 'F', and has exactly 5 characters in between. After trying an input that matched this pattern, I successfully got the flag.
