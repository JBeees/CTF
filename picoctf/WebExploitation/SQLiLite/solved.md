## Description
Can you login to this website?
Try to login here.
## Hint
- admin is the user you want to login as.
## Solution
To bypass the admin login, first note that submitting admin with an empty password fails and the application reveals the exact SQL query it uses:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='…' AND password='…';
```
By entering the username `admin'--` you close the string literal and comment out the remainder of the query (AND password=''). The database then executes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'-- ' AND password='';
```
Because everything after -- is ignored, the password check is skipped and you are logged in as admin. Inspecting the source code after login yields the flag.
