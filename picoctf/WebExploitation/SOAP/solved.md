# TITLE : SOAP
## Author : Geoffrey Njogu
## Description 
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?
## Hint
- XML external entity Injection
## Solution 
In this challenge, I am using Burp Suite as my testing tool. While intercepting traffic in Burp Suite, I noticed that the website sends a POST request whenever I click one of the three "Details" buttons.

In the HTTP history, I observed that the request body is in XML format. Each "Details" button sends the same request structure but with a different ID value.

I then sent one of these requests to Repeater in order to manipulate the XML content.

To attempt exploitation, I injected the following XXE payload:
```
<!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>
  <ID>&xxe;</ID>
</data>
```
This payload defines an external entity (xxe) that loads the contents of /etc/passwd from the server’s filesystem. The <ID> element then references this entity, causing the parser to replace &xxe; with the actual file contents when processing the XML.

By sending this modified request, the server should process the entity and return the contents of /etc/passwd in the response — which in this challenge contains the flag.
