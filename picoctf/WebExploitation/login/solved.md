## Solution
In this challenge, we are required to log in with the correct username and password. The login logic is implemented in index.js, where both the username and password are validated in base64-encoded form.

To solve the problem, we simply need to decode the base64-encoded strings used for the username and password comparison in the script. Once decoded, we can use those values to successfully log in.
