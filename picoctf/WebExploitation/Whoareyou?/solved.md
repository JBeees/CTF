# TITLE : Who are you?

Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/
## Hint
It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
## Solution
In this challenge, I used Burp Suite to solve it.
First, when I opened the website, it displayed the message:
```
"Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!"
```
This meant I had to modify the User-Agent in the request header. The User-Agent is a string that identifies the software (e.g., browser) making the request. I sent the request to Burp Suite Repeater and changed the User-Agent value to 
```
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
```
After sending it, the next response showed:
```
"I don't trust users visiting from another site."
```
This meant I had to add a valid Referer from the same website. The Referer header indicates the previous page the client visited before making the request. I added:
```
Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/
```
After resending, I received:
```
"Sorry, this site only worked in 2018."
```
This meant I needed to add a Date header with a value from 2018, for example:
```
Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:12:31 GMT
```
Then the response said:
```
"I don't trust users who can be tracked."
```
This meant I had to add the DNT (Do Not Track) header, which tells the browser/server that the user does not wish to be tracked:
```
DNT: 1
```
Next, I got:
```
"This website is only for people from Sweden."
```
To satisfy this, I added the X-Forwarded-For header with an IP address from Sweden:
```
X-Forwarded-For: 95.198.0.1
```
Finally, the site responded with:
```
"You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?"
```
To solve this, I changed the Accept-Language header to prefer Swedish:
```
Accept-Language: sv-SE,sv;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
```
After applying all these header modifications, I was able to get the flag.
