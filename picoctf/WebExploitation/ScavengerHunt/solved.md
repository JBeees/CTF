# TITLE : Scavenger Hunt
## Author : MADSTACKS
## Description 
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/. Can you find it?
## Hints :
- You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.
## Solution
In this problem, the first thing I did was inspect the page. In the HTML file, I found the first part of the flag inside an HTML comment.
To find the next part, I opened the CSS file and found the second part of the flag there.

For the third part, I checked the JavaScript file. Although it didn’t contain a piece of the flag, it did contain a clue:
`"How can I keep Google from indexing my website?"`
This reminded me of robots.txt, which is used to control what search engines like Google can index.
So I visited /robots.txt on the site, and I found the third part of the flag, along with another clue:
`"I think this is an Apache server... can you access the next flag?"`

I asked ChatGPT for help, and it suggested trying to access .htaccess at the root of the site. Sure enough, I found the fourth part of the flag there.

There was one final clue:
`"I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."`
Again, I asked GPT, and it suggested accessing .DS_Store — a file generated by macOS. When I visited it, I found the final part of the flag.
