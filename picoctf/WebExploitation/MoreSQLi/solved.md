## Description 
Can you find the flag on this website.
Try to find the flag here.
## Hints
- SQLiLite
## Solution
To solve this challenge, we can use Burp Suite to intercept the request.
In the password field, inject the payload `' OR 1=1 --` This makes the condition in the SQL query always evaluate to TRUE, bypassing authentication.
After forwarding the modified request, check the Response tab in Burp Suite â€” the flag will be displayed there.
