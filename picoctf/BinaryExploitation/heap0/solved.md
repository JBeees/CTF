## Solution

From the given c file, we could know that to get the flag from this problem, we have to change the value of safe_var to "pico". Then, try to run the executable file. Then we can see that from init function there are heap addresses of the input data and safe_var. Now to change the value of safe_var we have to know the *distance* between those both address so that we can change the value of safe_var by overflowing the value of input_data. To get the distance you can decrease those both address. From the given code the distance i get is 32(in decimal), so if i do input like **"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapico"**, it will change the value of safe_var into pico. Now you can try to put that input and *GET THE FLAG*
