# TITLE: two-sum
## Author: Mubarak Mikail
## Description
Can you solve this?
What two positive numbers can make this possible: n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2

## Hints
- Integer Overflow
- Not necessarily a math problem
## Solution
From the source code, we can see that the goal is to satisfy one of the conditions: n1 > n1 + n2 or n2 > n1 + n2. Under normal arithmetic, this is impossible with two positive integers. However, the key lies in triggering integer overflow.

Integer overflow occurs when a computed value exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. When this happens, the value wraps around, potentially becoming unexpectedly small or even negative.

To solve this challenge, choose two large positive integers such that their sum causes an overflow. This will make the result of n1 + n2 incorrect due to wrapping, and one of the conditions will evaluate as true allowing you to get the flag.
