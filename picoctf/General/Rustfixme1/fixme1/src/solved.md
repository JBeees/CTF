# TITLE : Rust fixme 1
## Author : Taylor McCampbell
## Description
Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!
Download the Rust code [here](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_verbal_sleep/3f0e13f541928f420d9c8c96b06d4dbf7b2fa18b15adbd457108e8c80a1f5883/fixme1.tar.gz).
## Hints
- Cargo is Rust's package manager and will make your life easier. See the getting started page here
- println!
- Rust has some pretty great compiler error messages. Read them maybe?
## Solution
In this challenge, we were given a .tar.gz file. The first step was to extract it using the following command:
```rs
tar -xzf file.tar.gz
```
After extracting the archive, I discovered that the project contained a Rust program managed by Cargo. When attempting to run it, I encountered syntax errors in the Rust source file. I analyzed the code and fixed the errors so that it became the following:
```
use xor_cryptor::XORCryptor;

fn main() {
    // Key for decryption
    let key = String::from("CSUCKS"); // How do we end statements in Rust?

    // Encrypted flag values
    let hex_values = ["41", "30", "20", "63", "4a", "45", "54", "76", "01", "1c", "7e", "59", "63", "e1", "61", "25", "7f", "5a", "60", "50", "11", "38", "1f", "3a", "60", "e9", "62", "20", "0c", "e6", "50", "d3", "35"];

    // Convert the hexadecimal strings to bytes and collect them into a vector
    let encrypted_buffer: Vec<u8> = hex_values.iter()
        .map(|&hex| u8::from_str_radix(hex, 16).unwrap())
        .collect();

    // Create decrpytion object
    let res = XORCryptor::new(&key);
    if res.is_err() {
        return; // How do we return in rust?
    }
    let xrc = res.unwrap();

    // Decrypt flag and print it out
    let decrypted_buffer = xrc.decrypt_vec(encrypted_buffer);
    println!(
        "{}", // How do we print out a variable in the println function? 
        String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted_buffer)
    );
}
```
After fixing the syntax issues, I executed the program using Cargo: `cargo run`. The program successfully decrypted the data and printed the flag, completing the challenge.
